# Platform Game
## Collaboration between Metta Crouse and Karl Watson

Our project is an infinitely scrolling vertical platform game for one or two players.
This game was made for the third quarter project of Galvanize's Web Development
Immersive program. It was built with Node.js, React, Phaser.io, D3.js, Express.js and
Knex. We welcome any feedback, so please visit our project and play the game!
